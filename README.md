A core that plays a few of the shouts from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
This core is unique due to the fact the shouts are actually functional.

These are the shouts included into the core:
Unrelenting Force (Pushes players and props away from itself in a certain radius),
Whirlwind Sprint (Pushes the core forward if unfrozen),
Fire Breath (Ignites all players and props in a certain radius),
Disarm (Strips all players of their weapons in a certain radius).

Made by Nortonv8, Dr. Matt and Pum.
